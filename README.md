# CSCI-3920-PA2-MessengerApp
A Clientâ€”Server  multithreading  system  for  a  messaging system like Slack, MS Teams, etc. The system  will  consist  of  two  applications: the  messenger  system and  a messaging client.  The messenger  system will run  a  server to maintain  users  and  relay messages  between  the  users. The  messaging  client  connects to  the  messenger  system, sign in the user and allow to send and receive messages. Users in the platform will have a username, password and display name. A user can send a direct message to another user by knowing his/her username. The messenger system will relay the message as soon as possible. However, if the message target user is not connected at that time, the message will be stored and the server will keep trying to relay the message.
